Hi! I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Stanford University. I will be on the job market for the 2024-2025 academic year. My main interests are Causal Inference and Machine Learning.

I have worked in a variety of projects requiring a wide range of skills. As a senior in undergrad I won an econometrics competition applying synthetic controls. In my PhD research I worked with Causal ML, DiD, IV and Machine Learning tools in settings with large geospatial datasets. In addition I was a Causal Inference intern at Wayfair where I developed a new inference approach with lower variance and Applied Science intern at Amazon where I fine-tuned and deployed LLMs.
