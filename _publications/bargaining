title: "Direct Sales and Bargaining"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'Cutting out the intermediary and selling directly to consumers is an increasingly common
strategy by manufacturers. We develop a structural model of vertical relations where
manufacturers bargain with retailers and sell their products directly to consumers. Direct
sales generate potential consumer gains due to additional competition and product variety
but also increase manufacturersâ€™ bargaining leverage, thereby increasing upstream and
downstream prices and potentially reducing consumer welfare. We estimate the model
using data from the outdoor advertising industry to quantify the bargaining-leverage and
welfare effects of direct sales. We discuss the relevance of the bargaining-leverage effect
for vertical merger evaluation.'
