title: "Does Titling Lead to Lower Deforestation? Evidence from Brazil."
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/titling
excerpt: 'Illegal deforestation has emerged as a critical global concern, leading to the introduction
of various countermeasures. A notable policy is the granting of formal
property rights to indigenous communities living in endangered areas. Despite its
increasing popularity, evidence regarding the effectiveness of this policy for curbing
deforestation remains scant, particularly concerning the conditions under which it operates
effectively. To address this gap, I investigate the staggered allocation of land
titles to indigenous communities in the Brazilian Amazon. I employ a doubly-robust
generalized difference-in-differences framework to assess the impact on deforestation. I
find that titling reduces the probability of deforestation by 7 percentage points. The
effect is driven by lands located in areas of high baseline deforestation and level of
enforcement.'
