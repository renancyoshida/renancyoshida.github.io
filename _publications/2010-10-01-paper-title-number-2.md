title: "Does Media Affect Land Conflict? Evidence from Brazil"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/titling
excerpt: 'Can media influence the amount of land redistribution? In a country where land
inequality is high and proper redistribution is scarce, the landless tend to mobilize
and occupy areas in order to pressure for more land reform. I show that in 1996 a
major event in Brazil received a lot of media coverage: a violent police repression of
landless occupiers. This increased public’s attention towards the government’s lack
of land reform and the role of the landless movement. I explore exogenous variation
in TV signal strength and show that media exposure increased both the number and
location of land occupations, leading to more people receiving land.'
